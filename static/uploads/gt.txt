This schedule gives you flexibility while keeping the project moving forward. Does this look good? Would you like any adjustments?




After testing, the project is hosted on a local server (for demo) or a cloud platform like Heroku or Render.

Environment setup and deployment instructions are documented.

Initial deployment may be for demo/testing purposes before a real-world launch.


Phase 7: Maintenance

Though it may not happen during your project timeframe, this phase explains:

Future updates or feature expansion (e.g., adding parent login or fee payments)

Bug fixes

Periodic data backups

Performance improvements

ensuring the school portal continues to function smoothly after deployment.

Initial deployment may be for demo/testing purposes before a real-world launch.


This phase involves making the school portal available for use by deploying it to a live or local server.

For this project, deployment was carried out on a local server for demonstration purposes. In real-world scenarios, this step would involve configuring a hosting environment, uploading the project files, connecting the database, and ensuring proper security measures are in place.

The aim is to test the system in a real environment, make it accessible to users, and ensure it performs as expected

To keep the system stable and up-to-date through regular fixes and improvements after deployment.
